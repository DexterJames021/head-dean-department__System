To calculate the percentage of points you've earned, you can follow these steps:

Add up the total number of points available, which in this case is 10.

Add up the number of points you earned.

Divide the number of points you earned by the total number of points available.

Multiply the result by 100 to get the percentage.

For example, if you earned 8 points:

Total points available = 10

Points earned = 8

Points earned / Total points available = 8 / 10 = 0.8

Percentage = 0.8 * 100 = 80%

So in this example, you would have earned 80% of the total points available.
